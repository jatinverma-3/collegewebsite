          The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bangalore requires
          that each accredited institution establish an Internal Quality Assurance
          Cell (IQAC) post accreditation. The purpose of the same is to maintain
          quality. NAAC suggests that IQAC shall put all effort and take measures
          towards the promotion of holistic academic excellence of the institution.
          The Internal Quality Assurance Cell is a crucial cell for
          institutionalization of quality. The cell will strategize initiatives in the
          college to fill the gaps and deficiencies to ensure quality and performance.
