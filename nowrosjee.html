          The Nowrosjee Wadia College, was established on July 21, 1932 within six
          months of the establishment of the Modern Education Society on February 15,
          1932. True to Its credo ‘For the Spread of Light’, the college pioneered
          efforts to open the portals of higher education to the residents of eastern
          parts of Pune and pursued them tirelessly through the last eighty
          resplendent years. Over the years, it has become the first choice to acquire
          an all-round quality education for many promising young men and women all
          over the country and abroad.
