          The Modern Education Society, Pune was established on 15th February, 1932,
          to meet the demand for education by the residents of the eastern part of the
          city of Poona. The efforts of its founder, Prin. V. K. Joag, and of the
          Wadia brothers, Sir Cusrow Wadia and Sir Ness Wadia,
          <br />
          The Modern Education Society came into being as a regular registered
          Educational Society formally at a meeting of its founder members at the
          Cowasjee Dinshaw Library Hall.
          <br />
          <br />
          It was at this meeting that the First Senate of the Modern Education Society
          was formed and the Senate decided on the recommendations of it’s Finance
          Council and Academic Council to establish from June 1932, a college
          affiliated to a University in the Poona Suburban Area. Thus, came into
          being, the ‘Nowrosjee Wadia College’ named after the Late Mr. Nowrosjee
          Wadia, father of Sir Cusrow Wadia and Sir Ness Wadia.

          True to Its credo &#039;For the Spread of Light&#039;, the Society pioneered
          efforts to open the portals of higher education to the residents of eastern
          parts of Pune and pursued them tirelessly through the last eighty
          resplendent years. The Society today has seven institutions in the bustling
          cities of Pune and Mumbai. Over the years, they have become the first choice
