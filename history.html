          In 1969, the Commerce wing, thus, came to be established as an independent
          college of commerce, named after Sir Ness Wadia, (1873-1952), the renowned
          industrialist and philanthropist of his times. The Modern Education Society
          is deeply indebted to Sir Ness as well as his brother Sir Cusrow for their
          unstinting support for this endeavour. The College moved into its present
          premises with a building of its own in 1971. The College was inaugurated on
          16th July 1969, by Dr. H. V. Pataskar,the then Vice- chancellor of the
          University of Pune.

        <div class="sir-ness-wadia-message">
          Sir Ness Wadia (1873-1952) was the second son of Bai Jerbai and Nowrosjee
          Ness Wadia. Sir Ness Wadia assisted his brother Sir Cusrow Wadia to carry
          forward their father’s legacy in business and philanthropic initiatives.
          Their efforts helped to scale up the operations of the Bombay Dyeing and
          Manufacturing Company and it became the largest textile operation in India.
          <br />
          After Sir Cusrow Wadia passed away, Sir Ness Wadia led the company’s growth,
          expansion, and modernization of the company. He was the first Indian to be
          awarded Knighthood of the British Empire in 1919.

          Learning Environment of the College
        </div>
        <div class="learning-environment-college-message">
          The inner passion of the staff of the college has always been to make the
          best use of its resources to promote a congenial learning environment for
          its students. The teachers are known for experimenting with a variety of
          teaching innovations, which supplement the usual lecture method. The
          activities of non-teachers are equally learning- centered. The college
          library, for instance, had set up a group of Book Lovers&#039; way back in
          the 70s. Aspirations of advanced learners and those in need of remedial
          inputs are both a part of the core concerns of the college, and the staff
          gears its activities to help students meet these aspirations.
